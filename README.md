# USER Management System

This project is a simple **Employee Management System** where users can add, edit, delete, and view employee details in a tabular format. The primary functionalities include editing an existing employee’s record by clicking on their name and adding a new employee. The project also calculates the total sum of the salaries of all employees displayed in the system.
